# Instructions

If you wish to fork and clone the code then feel free. 

This is a React project created with Vite, to run it please install node and then install all dependencies by running the following from a terminal:

- npm install
- npm run dev

## About

This code sample is extracted from my ongoing project, Rent-my-plot. The project aims to make surplus and unused land available to rent to the public in order to grow produce. 

Although it is not yet complete, it is intended to evolve into a fully responsive full-stack application developed in React Native.

I take immense pride in this code as it showcases my applied knowledge and expertise. It emphasises my ability to error handle and create modular and maintainable code, which I believe is crucial for robust applications.

The project is built with Vite, React, React Router 6.4, and various hooks like UseState, UseEffect, and custom hooks. The deployment process is streamlined through Netlify's continuous deployment.

I have designed the application to closely match an existing Figma prototype, ensuring a seamless user experience and visual consistency.

## Sidenote
The sample does not include a burger menu for mobile as I did not want to submit more code than necessary.

## Takeaways

To further improve the code I would unit test this application using a framework like Vitetest and end-to-end test with a tool like Cypress. Then going forward use an approach like test-driven development.
